# TicTacToe
The purpose of this game was just to learn mvvm,rxjava and data binding concepts. The repo is just replicate of https://github.com/Husaynhakeem/TicTacToe-MVVM . I got link of this repo from https://medium.com/@husayn.hakeem/android-by-example-mvvm-data-binding-introduction-part-1-6a7a5f388bf7,where he described detailed description of every module,which made easy to understand.
